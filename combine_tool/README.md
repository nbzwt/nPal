### How to use
Complie the source code, and move the output binary to the folder where your game files are located. Run it, then you will get a file named `resources.bin.tns`. This file should be sent to the `nPal` folder in your calculator.
Note that the extension of the game file should be `.tns` and all of the letters else should be upper case, such as `ABC.MKF.tns`.
